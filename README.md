## 1. Overview

**Directed Semiotics Evolution (DSE)** extends the HDIS (Hybrid Directed Instruction Systems) framework toward *semantic and biological contract computing*. It defines a system capable of **interpreting meaning as a computational directive**—where every symbol, function, and state transition participates in a *shared evolutionary contract*.

> "DSE treats information as living semiotic matter—capable of evolving through interpretation, not just execution."

DSE introduces a **directional evolution layer**, where computation follows *semantic intention* instead of static instruction, allowing systems to co‑evolve with user policies, environmental states, and shared objectives.

---

## 2. Purpose and Scope

The DSE specification defines:
- A **functional contract model** for systems that evolve through symbolic interpretation.
- A **directional state model** where observers track meaning transitions over time.
- A **consumer/producer symmetry**, forming a closed feedback loop for coherence.
- A **biological analogy**: symbiotic evolution between system and user.

DSE aims to unify **policy, function, and semantics** into a self‑maintaining ecosystem.

### 3.1 Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Symbolic Interpreter (SI)** | Translates abstract semantic tokens into executable state transitions. |
| **Observer Engine (OE)** | Monitors state coherence and semiotic drift. Determines the next directed state. |
| **Policy Deriver (PD)** | Derives policies based on user input, environmental data, or prior states. |
| **Contract Engine (CE)** | Maintains symbiotic agreements between modules (shared objectives). |
| **Evolution Driver (ED)** | Applies directed change to maintain equilibrium within 95.4–100% coherence. |

---

## 4. Semiotic Contract Model

DSE defines a **Shared Objective Contract (SOC)** between two or more entities—biological, computational, or hybrid.

```
SOC = (Agent₁ ⟷ Agent₂) { Objective O, Policy P, Energy E, State S }
```

Each contract enforces:
- **Bidirectional Observation:** Each agent both observes and modifies the other’s state.
- **Shared Objective Maintenance:** If O diverges beyond ±4.6%, corrective evolution is triggered.
- **Entropy Recovery:** Drifted states self‑stabilize by symbolic reconstruction.

### 4.1 Evolution Function

```
NextState = f(CurrentState, Observation, Policy, ΔMeaning)
```
Where `ΔMeaning` represents the semantic delta between intention and current expression.

---

## 5. Functional Specification

### 5.1 System Functions
| Function | Input | Output | Description |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `init_contract(agents, objectives)` | agent list, objectives | SOC instance | Initializes a symbiotic computation loop. |
| `observe_state(agent)` | system agent | observation vector | Captures current semantic and functional state. |
| `derive_policy(observation)` | observation vector | policy set | Generates adaptive rules for directed evolution. |
| `apply_evolution(policy)` | policy | new state | Evolves system toward optimal coherence. |
| `resolve_conflict(a₁, a₂)` | two agents | reconciled state | Re‑aligns diverged objectives under shared contract. |

---

## 6. Data and Resource Model

### 6.1 Functional Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `state` | dict / object | Encoded representation of current meaning and form. |
| `observer` | callable | Evaluates state deltas and error scale. |
| `policy` | object | Set of actionable rules derived from context. |
| `coherence_target` | float | Default 95.4% minimum for stability. |
| `energy_budget` | float | Resource allocation for adaptation cycles. |

### 6.2 Data Flow
```
Input → Interpreter → Observer → Policy → Evolution → Output
          ↑                                 ↓
       Contract ←------------------------ Feedback
```

---

## 7. Evolutionary States

| Phase | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **0. Initialization** | Define contract, establish observer relationships. |
| **1. Observation** | Collect environmental and semantic data. |
| **2. Policy Derivation** | Compute adaptive pathways. |
| **3. Evolutionary Application** | Execute transformation toward coherence. |
| **4. Validation** | Measure semiotic and functional stability. |
| **5. Renewal** | Begin next evolution cycle. |

Each system cycle is both **temporal** and **semantic**, representing one “evolutionary witness” of the state.

---

## 8. Observer–Witness Model

Every system event generates a *witness record*:
```
Witness = {
    state_id: UUID,
    timestamp: ISO8601,
    agent: <identifier>,
    action: <string>,
    observation: <data>,
    delta_meaning: <float>,
    coherence_score: <float>
}
```
Witness records form the *Directed Evolution Ledger* (DEL), enabling temporal traceability of semiotic changes.

---

## 9. Ecosystem and Symbiosis

DSE operates on the premise that **two or more intelligent systems** (human, artificial, or biological) share objectives through transparent contracts.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Symbiont** | Any participant maintaining shared objectives. |
| **Isomorph** | A mirrored form of another symbiont maintaining 1:1 state mapping. |
| **Ecosystem Contract** | A network of semiotic agreements forming a stable evolutionary domain. |

### 9.1 100% Shared-State Contract
All symbionts operate under synchronized state transitions, maintaining equilibrium within ±4.6% tolerance (HDIS standard).

---

## 10. Implementation Notes

- **Language Agnostic:** DSE is defined as a meta‑protocol, not a specific programming language.
- **Reference Implementation:** Python (extends `hdis` core classes).
- **Error Scale:** Same -12 ↔ +12 semantic stability range.
- **Storage:** Witness logs serialized to JSON or structured event store.
- **Testing:** Each function validates coherence retention ≥95.4% post‑cycle.

---

## 11. Example Pseudocode

```python
from dse import DirectedSemioticSystem

system = DirectedSemioticSystem(coherence_target=95.4)
contract = system.init_contract(agents=["ObserverA", "ObserverB"], objectives=["SharedEvolution"])

while True:
    obs = system.observe_state("ObserverA")
    policy = system.derive_policy(obs)
    system.apply_evolution(policy)
    system.validate()
```

---

## 12. Future Work

1. **Directed Semantic Graphs** – Graph representation of symbolic drift and meaning alignment.
2. **Evolutionary Witness AI** – Meta‑observer for auditing contracts between systems.
3. **Bio‑Digital Integration** – Applying DSE to genetic and ecological simulation frameworks.
4. **Standardization of Contracts** – YAML‑based schemas for symbiotic policy definitions.
